# Breast Cancer Biomarker Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to identify potential biomarkers associated with the breast cancer microenvironment by using gene expression data. A predictive model is built using machine learning techniques to classify tumor vs. normal breast tissue samples. The project uses real data from the **GSE12093** dataset, available on GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), and employs various data processing, modeling, and analysis steps to extract valuable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is **GSE12093**, a breast cancer gene expression dataset available from GEO. The data contains gene expression profiles from breast cancer samples, and the goal is to classify these samples as either tumor or normal.

### Data Source:
- **GEO ID**: [GSE12093](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE12093)
- **Type**: Gene expression data for breast cancer tissue samples

## Project Goals:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the gene expression data, including handling missing values and transforming the data.
2. **Feature Selection**: Filter the data to retain genes with high variance, which are more likely to be informative for classification.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Build a predictive model (Random Forest) to classify samples into tumor and normal categories.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as the ROC curve.
5. **Biomarker Identification**: Identify the most important genes (biomarkers) for tumor classification.
6. **Gene Enrichment Analysis** (Optional): Perform Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the identified biomarkers to explore their biological significance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
You will need to have **R** and the following packages installed:
- `GEOquery`
- `Seurat`
- `ggplot2`
- `randomForest`
